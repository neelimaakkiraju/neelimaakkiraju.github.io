					>Many novice writers tend to make a sharp distinction between content
					and style, thinking that a paper can be strong in one and weak in the
					other, but focusing on organization shows how content and style
					converge in deliberative academic writing. Your professors will view
					even the most elegant prose as rambling and tedious if there isn’t a
					careful, coherent argument to give the text meaning. Paragraphs are
					the “stuff ” of academic writing and, thus, worth our attention
					here.</strong
